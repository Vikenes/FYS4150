\begin{abstract}
    We investigate the 2D Ising model on a ($L\cross L$) lattice with beriodic boundary conditions by using the Metropolis algorithm to perform Monte Carlo simulations on the system. By performing Monte Carlo simulations we are able to compute estimates of the thermodynamical properties of the Ising model, in particular the specific heat capacity, $C_V$, and magnetic susceptibility, $\chi$. We study the temperature dependence of $C_V$ for lattice sizes of $L\in[40,60,80,100]$, from which we are able to estimate the critical temperatures where a phase transition occurs. By combining these results with finite size scaling relations, we are able to obtain an estimated value of the critical temperature for the 2D Ising model of infinite size. We estimate this critical temperature to be $T_C(L=\infty) \approx 2.2651\tunit$, compared to the analytical solution $T_C(L=\infty) \approx 2.2692\tunit$ as found by Lars Onsager in 1944 \cite{Onsager_Ising2D}\\
