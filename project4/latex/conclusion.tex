\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, we may say that we have successfully reproduced numerically an approximation of the analytical critical temperature of a 2D Ising model on an infinite lattice. Our approximation reads $T_C(L=\infty) \approx 2.2651\tunit$, which compared to the analytical expression $T_C(L=\infty)\approx 2.2692\tunit$ is a fairly decent result, but slightly too low. With an improved algorithm better suited for critical temperatures (see section \ref{subsec_discussion:limitations}), and/or a more thorough analysis, as discussed in sections \ref{subsec_discussion:sample_size_equi} and \ref{subsec_discussion:critical_temps_curvefit}, the approximation of critical temperatures, and the efficiency of which, would probably be improved greatly, perhaps also putting some uncertainties on the answer. Either would be a natural extension of this investigation.
