\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We conclude that our implementation and testing of both the FE ad RK4 scheme is correct since the solutions appear accurate in Figure \ref{fig:compare_z_analytical}, and the errors from Figures \ref{fig:error_FE} and \ref{fig:error_RK} behaves as we expect them to. For the two particle simulation, allowing them to interact pushed the particles further away from each, while both still show periodic behaviour. This is the physical solution as we are not able to switch off these interaction in a physical Penning trap. When including more particles. 

Introducing a time dependant perturbation to the electric potential does indeed give rise to resonance phenomena, as certain resonance frequencies empty the trap completely by pushing all particles out of it. We expect these frequencies to be in phase with either the magnetron or cyclotron frequencies \Johan{Deep water here ahaha}
