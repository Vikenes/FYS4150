\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\textit{In this section we state three things in a concise manner: what we have done, what we have found, and what should or could be done in the future.}

We provide the movement in the $z$-direction in figure \ref{fig:compare_z_analytical} as some sort of test to see whether the numerical integrations methods works or not. Hence, we use the fewest number of time steps, $n_1$ in order reveal the largest potential errors. From the figure they seem to overlap perfectly, however there is reason to think the error in the calculated solutions grow with time. This is indeed the case, as the error for the small duration $T_1$ is not visible due to the thickness of plotted lines and the scale of the plot. Although not shown here, if we were to zoom in on the graphs at a late time they do not overlap. Nevertheless, the calculated solution seems to fit the analytical quite well, but we are still interested in quantifying the error, which we expect to be smaller if we increase the number of time steps. 

Using the analytical solution as reference, the relative error, found from equation
