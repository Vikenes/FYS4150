\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Single particle}\label{sec:one_particle}
We start by simulating a single particle, Particle 1, with initial conditions given in \ref{sec:initial_conditions}. The duration of the simulation is set to $T = 50 \,\mathrm{\text{\textmu} s}$ and we use $n=4000$ time steps. In Figure \ref{fig:compare_z_analytical} we plot the $z$-component of the position as function of time. The solutions are found both using the FE and RK4 schemes, shown in red and blue respectively. \Johan{FE and RK4 defined shortening earlier?} \Nanna{- Yes, in introduction:)}. The analytical solution, found from equation \eqref{eq:p1_diffeq_solution_z} where the initial conditions yield $c_1 = z_0 = 20\,\mathrm{\text{\textmu}m}$ and $c_2 = v_{z,0}/\omega_z= 0$ is shown with green in the figure.

Since both FE and RK4 are approximations of the analytical solution we expect them to have a relative error compared with it. We repeat the simulations for $n = 8000$, $16000$ and $32000$ and find the relative error at each time step according to \Johan{(reference to relative error formula)}. The results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:error_FE} and \ref{fig:error_RK}. We note that for an increasing time step, the relative time step decrease, and the error for the RK4 scheme is significantly less than that of FE. \Johan{(ref some previous discussion with hs?)}

\subsection{Two particles}\label{sec:two_particles}

We simulate Particle 1 and Particle 2Â \Nanna{(Do not care about the capital letters, as long as we are consistent)} for $T = 50 \,\mathrm{\text{\textmu} s}$ using $n=8000$ steps, now also using both integration schemes. We do this both with Coulomb interactions turned off and on.

\subsection{Many particles}\label{sec:many_particles}

We now fill the trap with $N_\mathrm{p} = 100$ randomly distributed Ca$^+$-ions as elaborated in section \ref{sec:initial_conditions}. We add the perturbation to the external electric field in the trap described in section \ref{sec:code}. The following simulations are run for $T_2$\footnote{Strictly speaking, some of them are stopped before this due to an empty trap, but the result is the same.} before counting the number of particles still remaining in the trap, $N_\mathrm{trapped}$. Note that all simulations begin with equally initialised particles.

Using only the RK4 scheme, we perform two sorts of frequency scans:


\begin{itemize} % have absolutely no idea why I struggle with enumerate here
    \item[(i)] \textbf{Broad-band resonance search}: Run many simulations with interactions switched \textit{off} for a broad range of frequencies, but with equal magnitude of the perturbation. Log the number of particles remaining in the trap after each simulation.
    \item[(ii)] \textbf{Narrow-band resonance search}: Run several simulations with interactions turned \textit{on} for a narrow range of frequencies. The band is determined using the result of (i) to locate a small range of response frequencies. Repeat with interactions turned \textit{off} for comparison. Make sure the grid of frequencies is fine-grained compared to the one in (i). \Nanna{Rephrase} Repeat for interactions turned \textit{off} for comparison. Write down the number of particles trapped at $T_2$.
\end{itemize}

Three broad-band scans are performed, one for each of the amplitudes $f=\{0.1, 0.4, 0.7\}$. In particular, we run 300 simulations where we use the same amplitude $f$ and for each run, apply a different frequency $\omega_V \in[0.2,2.5] \,\mathrm{MHz}$. We reused the time step size from section \ref{sec:two_particles}. The fraction of particles remaining is presented in Figure \ref{fig:trapped_without} as a function of applied frequency. 

For the next step, we choose the smallest amplitude and the middle-most \Nanna{?} response in Figure \ref{fig:trapped_without}, i.e. $f=0.1$ and $\omega_V \in[1.35,1.45] \,\mathrm{MHz}$. We run 50 simulations, each with slightly different applied frequency, for which interactions forces are included. The number of steps is reduced to 20000 in this case, corresonding to a step size $2 T_1/n_1$ (twice that of the first simulation in section \ref{sec:one_particle}). We repeat for negligible interactions. Figure \ref{fig:trapped_with} shows $N_\mathrm{trapped}$ as a function of $\omega_V$ in both cases.
