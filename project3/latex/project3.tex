%This is how we create an abstract section.
\begin{abstract}
    The Penning trap is a device that uses a strong axial magnetic field together with a quadrupole electric field to capture charged particles within a spatial region. We model such a trap by assuming spherical symmetry, and consider an external electric and magnetic field, alongside an internal electric field set up by charged particles (Ca$^+$ ions) in the trap. We neglect the self induced magnetic field set up by moving charges. The equations of motion are determined by the Lorentz force, and we solve them numerically using two different integration schemes: The Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta 4 schemes. These methods offer different trade offs between computational expense and numerical accuracy, yielding a global error of $\mathcal{O}(h)$ and $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ respectively (for step size $h$). We check and confirm these errors by simulating one single particle for 50 $\mus$ for different time steps using both schemes. $h$ is small, thus the Runge-Kutta 4 scheme offers a far lower global error and is used when we make a simulation of two particles, where we also investigate the effect of the Coulomb interaction between particles. The trajectories of the particles, both in the $xy$-plane and in the phase spaces of $x$ and $z$ change when we allow for particle interaction. We also explore how 100 randomly distributed particles behave under the influence of a time dependant sinusoidal perturbation to the external electric potential. We simulate this for different amplitudes and frequencies, and find that certain resonance frequencies of this perturbation has the ability to completely empty the trap. These simulations are computationally very expensive and lengthy. However, we obtain results indicating that the simulation become unstable for applied frequencies of $\omega_V\in\{0.7,1.4, 2.2\}$ MHz. For a larger applied amplitude $f$, we see broader resonance lines centred around these resonance frequencies.
