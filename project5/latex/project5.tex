\begin{abstract}
    Simulations of the temporal evolution of wave functions satisfying the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation on a discretised spatial grid, satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. This partial differential equation is solved numerically using the Crank-Nicolson approximation, which prove to be a reliable solution as the deviation of the expected total probability over time is close to machine precision. An initialised wave packet is propagated through a zero-potential, showing dispersive behaviour, as well a through a single, double and triple slit configuration, where the observed diffraction patterns resemble well known wave behaviour. \\
