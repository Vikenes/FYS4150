\section*{Introduction}

To describe a one-dimensional buckling beam, we have the second order differential equation 

\begin{align}\label{eq:unscaled_eq}
    \gamma \dv[2]{u}{x} = -F u(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
\end{align}
where $L$ is the length of the horizontal beam, $F$ is the applied force at the end point $x=L$. $u(x)$ is the vertical displacement of the beam at the horizontal position $x$ and $\gamma$ is a constant determined by the properties of the material. We consider the endpoints to be pinned down, so that $u(0)=u(L)=0$. The endpoints are allowed to rotate, so $u'(x)\neq0$.

\section*{Problem 1}

We want to recast equation \eqref{eq:unscaled_eq} into a dimensionless equation, and we begin by defining the dimensionless length $\hat{x}\equiv x/L$, so that $\hat{x}\in[0,\,1]$. The second derivative with respect to $x$ is then 
\begin{align*}
    \dv[2]{x} = \dv[2]{\hat{x}}{x}\dv[2]{\hat{x}}=\frac{1}{L^2} \dv[2]{\hat{x}}
\end{align*}  

Equation \eqref{eq:unscaled_eq} can therefore be written as 
\begin{align*}
    \gamma \dv[2]{u(x)}{x} &= \frac{\gamma}{L^2}\dv[2]{u(x)}{\hat{x}} = -F u(x) \\ 
    \dv[2]{u(x)}{\hat{x}} &= - \frac{FL^2}{\gamma} u(x) \equiv -\lambda u(x)
\end{align*}
where we defined $\lambda\equiv F L ^2 / \gamma$. Inserting for $x=L\hat{x}$ yields 
\begin{align*}
    L \dv[2]{u(\hat{x})}{\hat{x}} &= -L \lambda u(\hat{x}) 
\end{align*}
Dividing by $L$ on both sides, we arrive at the scaled version of equation equation \eqref{eq:unscaled_eq}

\begin{align}\label{p1_scaled_eq}
    \dv[2]{u(\hat{x})}{\hat{x}} = -\lambda u(\hat{x}).
\end{align}

% COMMENT: As mentioned in the project description, we should mention that u_x(x)=u_\hat{x}(\hat{x})

\section*{Problem 2}
Before implementing the Jacobi algorithm, we create a test that checks whether we set up our tridiagonal matrix $A$ of size $N\cross N$ correctly. $A$ is defined by the signature $(a,\,d,\,a)$, where $a=-1/h^2$ and $d=2/h^2$ with $h$ being the step size $h \equiv(\hx_\mathrm{max}-\hx_\mathrm{min})/n$, where $n=N-1$. 

To test we write a short program in \CC\, that first sets up the tridiagonal $A$ for $N=6$, then uses the Armadillo library to solve the equation
\begin{align}
    A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} \label{eq:eig_equation_general}
\end{align} 
where $\vec{v}$ and $\lambda$ are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $A$, respectively. Finally, we compare the eigenvectors and eigenvalues from Armadillo with the analytical result for $N=6$. The analytical solution to equation \eqref{eq:eig_equation_general} for a matrix of size $N\cross N$ is given by  
\begin{align}
    \lambda^{(i)} &= d + 2a \cos\closed{\frac{i\pi}{N+1}},\quad i=1,\,\dots,\,N \\
    \vec{v}^{(i)} &= \bracket{ \sin\closed{\frac{i\pi}{N+1}},\,\dots,\,\sin\closed{\frac{Ni\pi}{N+1}} }^T ,\quad i=1,\,\dots,\,N
\end{align} 
The resulting eigenvectors of the two methods will be scaled before comparison. 
% COMMENT: Write about test? Comment on our cheeky method of absing the vectors?   

\section*{Problem 3}

\subsection*{a)}

In \CC, we write a function that identifies the largest off-diagonal element in absolute value in a symmetric Armadillo matrix and notes the matrix indices (in the upper tiangle) of this element.

\subsection*{b)}

We test the function on the matrix

\begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 \\
        0 & 1 & -0.7 & 0 \\
        0 & -0.7 & 1 & 0 \\
        0.5 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}

In particular, we make sure that the \CC-function yields the maximum value 0.7 at row $k=1$ and column $l=2$.

\section*{Problem 4}

\subsection*{a)}
In order to implement the Jacobi rotation algorithm we write two separate algorithms: Jacobi rotate, and Jacobi eigensolver:
\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Jacobi rotation}\label{algo:p4_jacobi_rotation}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \If{$A_{kl}^m = 0$}
            \State $c=1$
            \State $s=0$
            \State $t=0$
        \Else 
            \State $\tau = (A_{ll}^m-A_{kk}^m) / (2A_{kl}^m)$
            \If{$\tau > 0$}
                \State $t= 1/(\tau + \sqrt{1+\tau^2})$
            \Else
                \State $t = -1/(-\tau + \sqrt{1+\tau^2})$
            \EndIf
            \State $c=1/(\sqrt{1+t^2})$
            \State $s=ct$
        \EndIf
        \State $A_{kk}^{m+1} = c^2A_{kk}^m - 2csA_{kl}^m + s^2A_{ll}^m$
        \State $A_{ll}^{m+1} = c^2A_{ll}^m + 2csA_{kl}^m + s^2A_{kk}^m$
        \State $A_{kl}^{m+1} = 0$
        \State $A_{lk}^{m+1} = 0$
        \For{$i=0,1,2,\dots,N-1$}
            \If{$i\neq k \wedge i \neq l$}
                \State $A_{ik}^{m+1} = cA_{ik}^m -sA_{il} $
                \State $A_{ki}^{m+1} = A_{ik}^{m+1}$
                \State $A_{il}^{m+1} = cA_{il}^m + sA_{ik}^m$
                \State $A_{li}^{m+1} = A_{il}^{m+1}$
            \EndIf
            \State $R_{ik}^{m+1} = cR_{ik} - sR_{il}$
            \State $R_{il}^{m+1} = cR_{il} + sR_{ik}$
        \EndFor
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\subsection*{b)}



\section*{Problem 5}

Consider our symmetric, tridiagonal matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N\cross N}$ with signature $(a,d,a)$. Let $M$ denote the number of transformations needed for a Jacobi rotation algorithm to converge. That is, $M$ represents the number of iterations in the Jacobi rotation algorithm needed for the transformed matrix $A'$ to be similar enough\footnote{Choosing the number $\varepsilon=10^{-8}$ to be \textit{close enough} to zero.} to a diagonal matrix.

For $N=2,3,\dots,100$, we run the Jacobi eigensolver and save the corresponding integer $M$. We do this for both the tridiagonal matrix $A$ and an arbitrary symmetric square (dense) matrix $A^*$ of the same size as $A$. The result is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:p5_transformations_per_N}. From the graph in the figure we deduce that the number of transformations scales approximately exponential with matrix size $N$ for the tridiagonal matrix $A$. 


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{jacobi_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{The number of transformations $M$ as function of the matrix size $N$.}\label{fig:p5_transformations_per_N}
\end{figure}

Similar behaviour is seen for matrix $A^*$ which is not a tridiagonal matrix. We would perhaps expect a tridiagonal matrix like $A$ to converge with fewer transformations, since most of its entries are already zero. However, by running the Jacobi rotation algorithm on a tridiagonal matrix you might end up replacing zero (or close to zero) values with non-zero value in the attempt of rotating once. This mean you might have to put the same element to zero more than once and thus do more transformation that we initially would think. This is emphasized in figure Figure \ref{fig:p5_transformations_per_N} where the $M$-dependency of $A$ and $A^*$ are approximately the same.   


\section*{Problem 6}

\subsection*{a)}

For $n=10$ steps, i.e. $n+1=11$ points $\hat{x}_i$ and $A\in\mathbb{R}^{(n-1)\cross(n-1)} =\mathbb{R}^{9\cross 9}$, we solve the eigenvalue problem $A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$ using the Jacobi eigensolver. In addition, we solve the same problem with the analytic expressions for $\lambda^{(i)}$ and $\vec{v}^{(i)}$. This yields two versions of the normalised vectors $\vec{v}^{(i)}$, and for some $i$'s these are counter-oriented. When we encounter this situation, the issue is solved by forcing the result from the Jacobi algorithm $\vec{v}^{(i)} \rightarrow - \vec{v}^{(i)}$.

The three resulting eigenvectors $\vec{v}^{(1)}$, $\vec{v}^{(2)}$ and $\vec{v}^{(3)}$ corresponding to eigenvalues $\lambda^{(1)}$, $\lambda^{(2)}$ and $\lambda^{(3)}$ s.t. $\lambda^{(i)}<\lambda^{(j)}$ for $i<j$, are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:p6_solution_10steps}. The vectors are extrented with the boundary points, i.e. $v_0^{(i)}=v_0 = 0$ and $v_n^{(i)}=v_n=0$ for all $i$.

We do exactly the same as in \textbf{a)}, only now we use $n=100$ discretisation steps. The resulting plot is presented in Figure \ref{fig:p6_solution100steps}.

\section*{Problem 2}
We write equations using the LaTeX \texttt{equation} (or \texttt{align}) environments. Here is an equation with numbering
\begin{equation}\label{eq:newton}
    \vb{F} = \dv{\vb{p}}{t},
\end{equation}
and here is one without numbering:
\begin{equation*}
\oint_C \vb{F}\cdot \dd \vb{r} = 0.
\end{equation*}
Sometimes it is useful to refer back to a previous equation, like we're demonstrating here for equation \ref{eq:newton}.

We can include figures using the \texttt{figure} environment. Whenever we include a figure or table, we \textit{must} make sure to actually refer to it in the main text, e.g.\ something like this: ``In figure \ref{fig:rel_err} we show \ldots''. 
\begin{figure}%[h!]
    \centering %Centers the figure
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{imgs/rel_err.pdf} %Imports the figure.
    \caption{Write a descriptive caption here that explains the content of the figure. Note the font size for the axis labels and ticks --- the size should approximately match the document font size.}
    \label{fig:rel_err}
\end{figure}
Also, note the LaTeX code we used to get correct quotation marks in the previous sentence. (Simply using the \texttt{"} key on your keyboard will give the wrong result.) Figures should preferably be vector graphics (e.g.\ a \texttt{.pdf} file) rather than raster graphics (e.g.\ a \texttt{.png} file).

By the way, don't worry too much about where LaTeX decides to place your figures and tables --- LaTeX knows more than we do about proper document layout. As long as you label all your figures and tables and refer to them in the text, it's all good. Of course, in some cases it can be worth trying to force a specific placement, to avoid the figure/table appearing many pages away from the main text discussing it, but this isn't something you should spend time on until the very end of the writing process.


Next up is a table, created using the \texttt{table} and \texttt{tabular} environments. We refer to it by table \ref{tab:output_table}.
\begin{table}%[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Write a descriptive caption here, explaining the content of your table.}
    \begin{tabular}{c@{\hspace{1cm}} c}
        \hline
        Number of points & Output \\
        \hline
        10 &  0.3086\\
        100 &  0.2550\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}\label{tab:output_table}
\end{table}

Finally, we can list algorithms by using the \texttt{algorithm} environment, as demonstrated here for algorithm \ref{algo:midpoint_rule}.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Some algorithm}\label{algo:midpoint_rule}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State Some maths, e.g $f(x) = x^2$.  \Comment{Here's a comment}
        \For{$i = 0, 1, ..., n-1$}
        \State Do something here 
        \EndFor
        \While{Some condition}
        \State Do something more here 
        \EndWhile
        \State Maybe even some more math here, e.g $\int_0^1 f(x) \dd x$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
